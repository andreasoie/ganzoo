### CGAN - Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
> A implementation from scratch

&nbsp;

#### Reading Notes
- General
  - Uses conditioning to generate spesific images
  - Uses a joint hidden representation of noise and a condition variable vector to generate images
- Generator
  - MLP architecture
  - Uses fully connected layers
  - Uses normalization
- Discriminator:
  - MLP architecture
  - Uses fully connected layers
  - Uses normalization
